; Test new identifier syntax
; Text names: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*
; Graphical names: [+=.,<>?@#:$-]+

; Text names with hyphens
1 /add-one
add-one print

2 /my-var
my-var print

; Graphical names (can't be bound, but can be used as operators)
1 2 + print

; Multi-char graphical names
; These are parsed as single tokens but undefined
; (we test parsing, not evaluation here)

; + and - followed by digit are numbers
+5 print
-5 print

; Adjacent tokens without whitespace
; 1+2 parses as: 1, +2 (two numbers)
1+2 print print   ; prints 2 then 1 (stack order)

; Text names can't contain symbols
; foo+bar would be: foo, +, bar (if + not followed by digit)
; or: foo, +123 (if followed by digit)
