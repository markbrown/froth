; Test new identifier syntax
; Text names: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*
; Graphical names: [+=.,<>?@#:$-]+

; Text names with hyphens
{ "\n" println! } /nl

1 /add-one
add-one println!

2 /my-var
my-var println!

; Graphical names (can't be bound, but can be used as operators)
1 2 + println!

; Multi-char graphical names
; These are parsed as single tokens but undefined
; (we test parsing, not evaluation here)

; + and - followed by digit are numbers
+5 println!
-5 println!

; Adjacent tokens without whitespace
; 1+2 parses as: 1, +2 (two numbers)
1+2 println! println!   ; prints 2 then 1 (stack order)

; Text names can't contain symbols
; foo+bar would be: foo, +, bar (if + not followed by digit)
; or: foo, +123 (if followed by digit)
