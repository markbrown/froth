; Test delete operator

; Create a map with 3 entries
$ 1 'x : 2 'y : 3 'z : /m

; Check initial size
m # println!

; Delete 'y key
m 'y delete /m2

; Check size after delete
m2 # println!

; Verify 'y is gone
m2 'y in println!

; Verify 'x and 'z still exist
m2 'x @ println!
m2 'z @ println!

; Delete non-existent key (should be no-op)
m2 'foo delete # println!

; Original map unchanged
m # println!
