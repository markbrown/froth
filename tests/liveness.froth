; Test liveness analysis

; Helper to run liveness and print result
{ /f f boundness! /bnd /bs /fs f fs bs bnd liveness! write nl! } /test-liveness

; Basic cases
'{x} test-liveness!
; [1] - single free var is last-ref

'{x x} test-liveness!
; [0 1] - first x still live, second x last-ref

'{/x x} test-liveness!
; [. 1] - binder is ., x is last-ref

'{x /x x} test-liveness!
; [1 . 1] - both x's are last-ref (different vars)

'{/x x x} test-liveness!
; [. 0 1] - first x still live, second x last-ref

; Nested closures
'{x {x} x} test-liveness!
; [0 [1] 1] - outer x captured by closure, still live

'{x {x}} test-liveness!
; [0 [1]] - outer x captured by closure

'{x {/x x}} test-liveness!
; [1 [. 1]] - outer x not captured (shadowed)

'{{x}} test-liveness!
; [[1]] - nested closure

; Nested generators (share scope)
'{x [x] x} test-liveness!
; [0 [0] 1] - generator shares scope, x still live

'{x [x]} test-liveness!
; [0 [1]] - generator's x is last-ref

'{x [/x x] x} test-liveness!
; [0 [. 1] 1] - generator binder is local

; Empty cases
'{{}} test-liveness!
; [[]] - empty nested closure

'{[]} test-liveness!
; [[]] - empty generator

; Multiple variables
'{x y} test-liveness!
; [1 1] - both are last-refs

'{x y x} test-liveness!
; [0 1 1] - first x still live

'{x y x y} test-liveness!
; [0 0 1 1] - first x and y still live

; Operators (not tracked in liveness)
'{1 2 +} test-liveness!
; [. . .] - literals and operators
